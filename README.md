# General Info
This project began with the intention of working with the [GoBabyGo program](https://sites.udel.edu/gobabygo/ "UD Mobility Technology | GoBabyGo!") of the charity organization [Variety of Illinois](https://www.varietyofillinois.org/ "Variety of Illinois"). Unfortunately, plans changed due to unforseen circumstances. Instead of working with Variety, we instead set out to achieve the same goal as the GoBabyGo program despite not having an actual client to work with. We began by constructing a persona, Bobby.

Bobby is a 7 year old child, paralyzed from the waist down. He is trying to drive a toy electric car but he has trouble operating it. He has trouble because his physical disability prevents him from using the carâ€™s braking and acceleration pedals and he is unable to get himself into the car by himself. These factors combine to make him feel left out and not included in his neighborhood when the other children are playing with their cars.

To be clear, Bobby is an imaginary individual, however he has very real problems and characteristics.

Our goal at this point was to come up with a solution to help make Bobby feel more included in his neighborhood.

Following the creation of our persona, we began our research for our project. Eventually, we came to the conclusion that designing a children's electric vehicle with accomadations for Bobby would be the best route. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances of the time ([COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/ "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) | CDC")), we were unable to physically fabricate our vehicle design. Instead, we created a 3D model using Autodesk Inventor. The main features of the model car are a steering wheel with buttons for acceleration and braking and a frame on the car to allow Bobby to assist himself into the vehicle.

The final step of this project was to pitch our idea to the class. Below you will find the slides presentation when they are completed.
